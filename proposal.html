        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
      </header>

      <p>
        <cite><a href="https://www.tastingtable.com/974938/reasons-why-college-students-have-a-hard-time-with-healthy-eating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Many college students struggle to eat healthy meals</a></cite> due to time, budget, and dietary restrictions. People who have allergies or unique dietary restrictions also find it difficult to look for recipes that cater to their specific needs. It is important for college students to have a medium where they can find recipes with locally accessible ingredients, share favorite recipes with friends, and filter recipes by preferred price range and diet all at once.
      </p>

      <p>
        Students face a significant challenge organizing and managing meal planning data that can be easily accessible with a busy schedule. Existing meal planning and recipe applications often lack a personalization aspect, making it difficult for students to find quick and cheap recipes catering to their preferences. These apps also may not always provide students with affordable meal options or allow students to share favorite recipes and rate attempted recipes.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Previous Existing Attempts To Solve Problem</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Recipes websites such as Allrecipes and The Food Network offer a wide range of free to use recipes with step-by-step instructions. However, there are an overwhelmingly amount of choices that are not catered towards college students due to inconsistent quality, time-consuming, expensive ingredients, and lack of nutrition information within the recipes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meal kit delivery services such as HelloFresh offer pre-measured and fresh ingredients for easy cooking recipes. However, college students might find the cost prohibitive as these services are often more expensive than buying groceries and cooking from scratch. Students might also become dependent on the service and not learn how to cook for themselves.
        </li>
        <li>
          Following recipes from food influencers on social media platforms such as Tiktok, Instagram, or Pinterest can be a creative way to find new recipes. However, their recipes are often presented in a highly stylized and edited manner which can set unrealistic expectations for students who are trying to cook in their home. A lot of these recipes tend to not list the time, prices, or nutritional values within these recipes which is information that college students value.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is a similar app that allows users to rank restaurants called <cite><a href="https://beliapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beli</a></cite> but it doesn't sufficiently address this topic for college students. Although Beli provides a platform for users to rate local restaurants, it does not provide personalized recipe recommendations that are quick and accessible for college students.
        </li>

            <h2>App Description</h2>
        </header>

        <p>This app allows college students to manage their daily meals while maintaining a healthy and productive lifestyle. Users will be able to view information from local grocery stores and comparisons of prices of various food items among these stores. This information comes from a spreadsheet made by U-District resident Ruby Price.</p>

        <p>This app will help solve our problem because it will give college students a place to go to find healthy, affordable meal plans that can be customized to their liking. By putting all this infomation in one place, students will have a much more efficient experience when picking recipes, buying ingredients, and making their meals. Students can also add their own recipes! By sharing personal recipes, users can contribute to their community and help others come up with their own recipes.</p>

      <h3>Users and Impact</h3>
      <p>
        The users and the people who will be accessing this website will be college students, in particular University of Washington students, that are living away from home where their source of food relies on themselves and their cooking. These students are potentially struggling financially and/or do not have the time to cook meals for themselves that fit their nutritional and dietary needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The minority group will be students whom are struggling to consume healthy and nutritious meals due to a variety of reasons. This app could impact them by allowing them to find not only a variety of recipes that can be filtered to match the student's requested range of price, cooking time, and dietary restrictions, but they will be able to see where they can buy the ingredients from a nearby grocery store. This will address the issue with pricing and also ensuring that the ingredient is in-stock at their local grocery store. Additionally, the app will display the nutritional value of the recipes so that the students can be aware of what their eating and choose their recipes with that factor in mind.
      </p>

      <h3>Interactive Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Create and share recipes: Students will be able to create a recipe and share them to their choice of the public, friends, or private to themselves.
        </li>
        <li>
          Personalized lists of recipes: Students will be able to add other people's recipes into their own lists of recipes they want to try and a list of recipes they've already tried where they can rank the recipes from 0-10 based off different categories such as taste, affordability, time consumption, and more.
        </li>
        <li>
          Connecting to grocery availability data: The website will connect to a fake database/csv (as a real-world connection might be too difficult for the scope of this class). Students will be able to view the prices and availability of ingredients for a recipe within a local grocery store.
