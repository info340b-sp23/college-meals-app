        <p><cite><a href="https://www.tastingtable.com/974938/reasons-why-college-students-have-a-hard-time-with-healthy-eating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Many college students struggle to eat healthy meals</a></cite> due to time, budget, and dietary restrictions. People who have allergies or unique dietary restrictions also find it difficult to look for recipes that cater to their specific needs. It is important for college students to have a medium where they can find recipes with locally accessible ingredients, share favorite recipes with friends, and filter recipes by preferred price range and diet all at once.</p>

        <p>Students face a significant challenge organizing and managing meal planning data that can be easily accessible with a busy schedule. Existing meal planning and recipe applications often lack a personalization aspect, making it difficult for students to find quick and cheap recipes catering to their preferences. These apps also may not always provide students with affordable meal options or allow students to share favorite recipes and rate attempted recipes.</p>

        <!--Who are the users, etc. (Judy)-->
        <p>There is a similar app/website that allows users to rank recipes called <cite><a href="https://beliapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beli.</a></cite></p>
        <!--What kind of information will the users be viewing? (Ramya)-->

        <p>Users will be viewing information about local grocery stores and comparisons of prices of various food items between the stores. This information comes from a spreadsheet made by U-District resident Ruby Price.</p>

        <p>This app will help solve our problem because it will give college students a place to go to find healthy, affordable meal plans that can be customized to their liking. By putting all this infomation in one place, students will have a much more efficient experience when picking recipes, buying ingredients, and making their meals. Students can also add their own recipes! By sharing personal recipes, users can contribute to their community and help others come up with their own recipes.</p>
