        </header>

        <p>Many college students struggle to eat healthy meals due to time, budget, and dietary restrictions. People who have allergies or unique dietary restrictions also find it difficult to look for recipes that cater to their specific needs. It is important for college students to have a medium where they can find recipes with locally accessible ingredients, share favorite recipes with friends, and filter recipes by preferred price range and diet all at once.</p>

        <p>Students face a significant challenge organizing and managing meal planning data that can be easily accessible with a busy schedule. Existing meal planning and recipe applications often lack a personalization aspect, making it difficult for students to find quick and cheap recipes catering to their preferences. These apps also may not always provide students with affordable meal options or allow students to share favorite recipes and rate attempted recipes.</p>
