        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
      </header>

      <p>
        Many college students struggle to eat healthy meals due to time, budget,
        and dietary restrictions. People who have allergies or unique dietary
        restrictions also find it difficult to look for recipes that cater to
        their specific needs. It is important for college students to have a
        medium where they can find recipes with locally accessible ingredients,
        share favorite recipes with friends, and filter recipes by preferred
        price range and diet all at once.
      </p>

      <p>
        Students face a significant challenge organizing and managing meal
        planning data that can be easily accessible with a busy schedule.
        Existing meal planning and recipe applications often lack a
        personalization aspect, making it difficult for students to find quick
        and cheap recipes catering to their preferences. These apps also may not
        always provide students with affordable meal options or allow students
        to share favorite recipes and rate attempted recipes.
      </p>

      <h3>Previous Existing Attempts To Solve Problem</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Recipes websites such as Allrecipes and The Food Network offer a wide
          range of free to use recipes with step-by-step instructions. However,
          there are an overwhelmingly amount of choices that are not catered
          towards college students due to inconsistent quality, time-consuming,
          expensive ingredients, and lack of nutrition information within the
          recipes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meal kit delivery services such as HelloFresh offer pre-measured and
          fresh ingredients for easy cooking recipes. However, college students
          might find the cost prohibitive as these services are often more
          expensive than buying groceries and cooking from scratch. Students
          might also become dependent on the service and not learn how to cook
          for themselves.
        </li>
        <li>
          Following recipes from food influencers on social media platforms such
          as Tiktok, Instagram, or Pinterest can be a creative way to find new
          recipes. However, their recipes are often presented in a highly
          stylized and edited manner which can set unrealistic expectations for
          students who are trying to cook in their home. A lot of these recipes
          tend to not list the time, prices, or nutritional values within these
          recipes which is information that college students value.

      <h3>Users and Impact</h3>
      <p>
        The users and the people who will be accessing this website will be
        college students, in particular University of Washington students, that
        are living away from home where their source of food relies on
        themselves and their cooking. These students are potentially struggling
        financially and/or does not have the time to cook meals for themselves
        that fit their nutritional and dietary needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The minority group will be students whom are struggling to consume
        healthy and nutritious meals due to a variety of reasons. This app could
        impact them by allowing them to find not only a variety of recipes that
        can be filtered to match the student's requested range of price, cooking
        time, and dietary restrictions, but they will be able to see where they
        can buy the ingredients from a nearby grocery store. This will address
        the issue with pricing and also ensuring that the ingredient is in-stock
        at their local grocery store. Additionally, the app will display the
        nutritional value of the recipes so that the students can be aware of
        what their eating and choose their recipes with that factor in mind.
      </p>

      <h3>Interactive Features</h3>

          share them to their choice of the public, friends, or private to
          themselves.

        <li>
          Personalized lists of recipes: Students will be able to add other
          people's recipes into their own lists of recipes they want to try and
          a list of recipes they've already tried where they can rank the
          recipes from 0-10 based off different categories such as taste,
          affordability, time consumption, and more.
        </li>
        <li>
          Connecting to grocery availability data: The website will connect to a
          fake database/csv (as a real-world connection might be too difficult).

          ingredients for a recipe within a local grocery store.
