# INFO 340 Project

This repository contains code for an interactive information web app, that functions as a feed and platform for college students to browse and filter through friends' recipes, create their own profile, and access nearby grocery stores for shopping directly from the app. Students can filter recipes based on their own unique dietary restrictions, preferances, and budget limits.
